    "# Bias & Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is __Bias?__\n",
    " - Bias is when you are fitting a line to a trend and the machine learning method cannot capture the true relationship.\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"Bias Chart.png\" style=\"width:400px;height:250px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Because this stright line cannot be curved like the \"true\" relationship, there is alot of bias.\n",
    " - In the following image, we can also fit a squigly line fit to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\" style=\"width:400px;height:250px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you can see it fits the __training set__ very well compared to the straight line, and has __low bias__\n",
    "- We can do calculate this mathematically by squaring the distince from each point to the line and summing them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although the squigly fit works for the __training set__ of data, lets see how well it works for the __testing set__\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic3.png\" style=\"width:400px;height:250px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case, the straight line fits better to the testing set than the squigly fit\n",
    "- Therefore the squigly fit has much more __variance__ compared to the straight line fit\n",
    " - Its hard to predict how well the __Squiggly Line__ will perform with future data sets\n",
    " - When a fit works well with the training set but not testing set, we call the fit __overfit__ \n",
    "- The __straight line__ has low __variance__, because the Sums of Squares are very __similar__ for different data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a result, the __straight line__ will likely give \"good\" predictions but not great, but they will be consistent\n",
    "- On the other hand the __squigly line__ will either give great or bad predictions, very inconsistent\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our goal is to find the sweet spot between a simple model (linear regression), and a complex model (squigly line fit)\n",
    " - Methods to find these sweet spots are called __regularization, boosting__ and __baggin__."
